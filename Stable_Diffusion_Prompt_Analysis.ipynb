Quite expected, but it could mean more creative control over a lot of things when combining popular fields. For example, we could try to combine \"magazine cover\", \"news headline\", \"scientific revue\", \"fashion shot\", etc and see how it merge it all.\\n\\nSuch keywords could also be a nice shortcut to merge complex prompt settings over framing and other creative decisions, like some are doing by using popular artist names.  \n",

The second to last image is \"a hyperrealistic futuristic city with flying cars and a zeppelin\", while the last image drops the \"hyperrealistic\", being \"a futuristic city with flying cars and a zeppelin\" This is the result.\\n\\nIt's very interesting that adding \"digital art\" was the most important part to define the final style of the image, as the latter two differ very much from the rest. With \"digital art\", they are all kind of similar.\\n\\n\"Hypermaximalist\" and \"elegant\" were mainly responsible of adding detail to the ship. \"Ray Tracing Reflections\" was mainly responsible for adding all the blue colors in the image.  \n",

My basic process is this:\\n\\n1. Get all the lyrics for the song\\n2. Time sync all the lyrics\\n3. Add additional prompts for the musical interludes\\n4. Figure out some good extra prompts to put onto each lyric\\n5. Generate 5-10 images with different seeds\\n6. Pick the best one\\n7. Generate a video for each image\\n8. Stich the videos together and sync the music\\n9. Upscale to 1440p and use frame interpolation to double framerate\\n\\nFor this video I used the lyrics for each frame, plus the additions:  \\n`, people in nature, elegant, artstation, illustration, 8k wallpaper, wide shot, masterpiece by Greg Rutkowski and daniel dociu and artgerm and frederick lord leighton`\\n\\nSo an example would be:  \\n`Everybody's dancing in the moonlight, people in nature, elegant, artstation, illustration, 8k wallpaper, wide shot, masterpiece by Greg Rutkowski and daniel dociu and artgerm and frederick lord leighton`\\n\\nFor the musical interludes, I used base prompts like:  \\n`large full moon, man playing piano`\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would really appreciate any tips or suggestions for how I could make these videos better. I'm having a lot of fun making them and would love to improve them as much as possible!  \n",

The bulk of the prompt is a description of the content in the region I'm working on followed by \"in the style of Studio Ghibli, illustrated by Kazuo Oga, Hayao Miyazaki\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe process for this one was using img2img with k\\_lms and k\\_euler\\_a at different settings until I had a couple of images I liked. I combined the best features of each image in Photoshop and also did some extra inpainting for areas like the mushrooms. For the final girl character I ended up using v1.5 in DreamStudio and composited it in, with some additional digital painting touch up. The image was then ran through txt2imghd with the original prompt \"A cute girl behind a fence in a beautiful garden in the style of Studio Ghibli, illustrated by Kazuo Oga, Hayao Miyazaki\" at different strengths, and the best parts were composited in Photoshop.

It's based on a [change I proposed](https://github.com/basujindal/stable-diffusion/pull/117#issuecomment-1236387342) yesterday to [neonsecret's fork](https://github.com/neonsecret/stable-diffusion) \\n    \\nIt uses automatic splitting of work into blocks that fit into your GPU's memory. Allows for rendering higher than 2048x2048 on a 3090 while not affecting speed when running lower resolutions. Does assume rendering at half precision, will post a fix later to also support full precision.\\n    \\nRealistically though, you can't go higher than 2048x1536 (or 3MP) without breaking other parts of the model. I might fix those too but not sure if it's worth it, rendering at 3MP is already pretty slow (about 2 minutes for 25 steps on a 3090). \\n    \\nProvided example image prompt is (from [libraire.ai](https://libraire.ai)):\\n    \\npebble beach waterfall, extremely detailed oil painting, unreal 5 render, rhads, sargent and leyendecker, savrasov levitan polenov, bruce pennington, studio ghibli, tim hildebrandt, digital art, landscape painting, octane render, beautiful composition, trending on artstation, award winning photograph, masterpiece\\n   \\n\\n`Edit (5 sept):`   \\nI just checked in some changes to model.py as well, this should allow people to go higher who are crashing after rendering is done 100% (might still happen at even higher resolutions, but shouldn't happen as fast now)**\\n\\n[Rendered this](https://i.ibb.co/9VZTSSn/Generated-20220905202022.png) with a 3090 at 4096x1024 going much higher increases memory usage exponentially, so probably not very feasible    \\n     \\n\\n`Edit2 (6 sept):`   \\nJust checked in another update to fix the available memory calculation, should fix some crashes people were having at unexpected resolutions. Also added an error that is thrown when you don't have enough VRAM available to run the batch. Also gives an approximation of your maximum possible resolution at current free VRAM levels.  \n",

A fitting description (with time I learnt the description must be quite precise, \"reminding\" SD of what I want, otherwise some elements will be invariably lost). ***gorgeous young woman, magenta hair, golden crown, white dress, sitting on a rock, night, full yellow moon. green grass.***\\n\\nYou can already notice that I add a lot of \"useless\" details. Like the color of the moon and of the grass.\\n\\nYeah. Turns out they are not so useless. Without specifying them, the grass can turn blue and the moon completely green!\\n\\n3. Adding a lot of \"modifiers\" to force SD to keep a precise style. In this case a realistic and beautiful one. ***intricate, elegant, sharp focus, cinematic, render, 3d, highly detailed, digital art, matte, art by WLOP and Artgerm, photography, masterpiece, realistic, hyper realistic, HD, 8K***\\n\\nMove to a img2img and use the starting image and the complete prompt ***gorgeous young woman, magenta hair, golden crown, white dress, sitting on a rock, night, full yellow moon. green grass. intricate, elegant, sharp focus, cinematic, render, 3d, highly detailed, digital art, matte, art by WLOP and Artgerm, photography, masterpiece, realistic, hyper realistic, HD, 8K***\\n\\nHave a lot of patience!!!\\n\\nIndeed I need to be extra-careful at each single step. Every single misstep is then very hard to be corrected.\\n\\n4. Adjusting the weights prompt/image to move on, without losing important features (which are usually lost for good). Typically my starting value is to give prompt and image the same weight and then, if the result doesn't move on enough, increasing the weight of prompt; if, instead, some good feature of the previous image is lost, increasing the weight of the image.\\n\\n5. 1 hour later (and a passage with baseten to \"clean\" the lines) the final result is this:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Final result](https://preview.redd.it/dfyslg4fysq91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d55e55510a65a357faaaaa86f4976c8ee068072)\\n\\nWhich is not bad at all, mind you.\\n\\nBUT!\\n\\nBut at this point I hit a wall. If I keep the image weight too high there is apparently no difference between the steps. If I lower it below some point, bang, it messes with the image (deforming her face, etc), instead of \"refining\" it.\\n\\n**This happens when the image and the prompt are quite complex (if the image/prompt are simple, like about a face, then I can usually get better, more defined results).**\\n\\nAnyone else had the same problem? How did you resolve it (if you did) for **complex images/prompts**? Is there a way to say to SD \"Hey, this complex image I give you is kinda cool already, just make it a bit sharper\"?   \n",

Pieced the prompt together from a few I've seen while reading through this sub the past week, with some additions of my own.\\n\\nRan a couple dozen iterations on the portrait to get a crown and gown I liked, then added ((armored)) to the prompt and dropped tiara, readded the face and started outpainting down and to the left to get a bust shot of some sick gown armor with Evangelion-lite pauldrons and a ruff of fur at the armpit, for those cold nights. Then the looping started.\\n\\nBiggest thing for me was having to manually re-add the green eyes every time I fed back to SD. I ended up taking out (((green eyes))) ### (((brown eyes))), (((black eyes))), (((blue eyes))) cuz they didn't do a thing.\\n\\nAlterations and touchups were completed manually in GIMP. I have a bit of experience editing but never had the touch for painting: SD is truly a game-changer for me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCheers, and thank you for your views, comments, criticism and most of all this wonderful sub!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSource\\n\\n[Gene Tierney](https://preview.redd.it/5pq54jnu0dq91.jpg?width=295&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f15bfe492050edac8a99c34632e96124f2717d1e)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPositive\\n\\nPainting of a warrior princess wearing a tiara and an ornate ((armored)) (((bodycon))) renaissance dress with magic gauntlets and a fur collar, fantasy, cinematic lighting, highly detailed, octane, digital painting, artstation, concept art, smooth, sharp focus, illustration, vibrant colors, 3d render, in the style of hearthstone, ultra-HD, insanely detailed and intricate, hypermaximalist, elegant, ornate\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNegative\\n\\n(((out of frame))), (((cut head))), ((cut body)), ((two heads)), totem pole, several faces, extra fingers, mutated hands, ((poorly drawn hands)), ((poorly drawn face)), (((mutation))), (((deformed))), ((ugly)), blurry, ((bad anatomy)), (((bad proportions))), ((extra limbs)), cloned face, glitchy\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMisc\\n\\nIMG2IMG\\n\\nSS20 - Euler\\_a\\n\\nRestore Faces - GFPGan\\n\\nCFG Scale 7\\n\\nDenoising Strength .25 to create, .15 with Loopback to refine\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLOOPBACK\\n\\nLoops 10\\n\\nDenoising Strength Change Factor 0.92\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOUTPAINTING\\n\\nMask Blur 8\\n\\nFall-off 0.7\\n\\nColor Variation 0.05\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUPSCALE\\n\\nResize 4\\n\\nReal-ESRGAN 4x plus   \n",

So I made [CLIP gaze](https://pypi.org/project/clip-gaze/), a python package that inspects art by calculating the relative likelihood from a list of prompts.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[\\\\\"A loney castle by Lee Madgwick. Photorealisitic painting.\\\\\" 50 iterations, strength 7.5, seed=0 ](https://preview.redd.it/nndljr3cn6q91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be1b27432f597481b32d854311e59106104c406)\\n\\nFor the SD-generated image above here are the highest scoring options by category:\\n\\n* Lee Madgwick (65%) for the artist\\n* Gothic Art (15%) for the art movement\\n* Oil Painting (17%) for the medium\\n* Architectural Structure (43%) for the canvas (I can see where it got confused)\\n* Deviantart (61%) for the website\\n* Aerosol paint (41%) for the tool\\n* Mezzotint (70%) for the printing technique\\n\\nThe package comes with preset lists of options for the above (including a list of the 900 or so artists ordered by prevalence in SD's training data, and another of 6000 artists). You can, however, give the tool any list of options you like, so I asked it `clip_gaze.gaze(image, [\"Ruined Castle\", \"Habitable Castle\"])` and the results were:\\n\\n* Ruined Castle (66%)\\n* Habitable Castle (34%)\\n\\nAnd then asked for the mood:\\n\\n* Sombre mood (83%)\\n* Cheerful mood (17%)\\n\\nWhich I think is a good enough indication of its versatility.\\n\\n(The percentages are for guidance rather than being a true measure of confidence or predictive power -- I haven't tried calibrating them yet.)   \n",

Thought I'd share my favorites! :)\\n\\nBe careful with that girl in a cabin prompt.  Most of the generated images nearly gave me nightmares.\\n\\nA lot of those Mandelbrot fractal images are pretty similar to what the Mandelbrot fractal really looks like, with certain render styles.

However, after being upgraded by GPT3 to include background, artist, modifiers... the resulting prompt produces absolutely gorgeous images like this one. And all that is typed by the user is \"a white wolf\" because \"Sir G\" the AI writes the rest of the prompt for you.\\n\\nDuring the training, which was conducted as an open ended chat between myself and GPT3, his abilities gradually improved as I provided feedback and examples, and kept reminding him that miss stability would fall for him quicker if he did his job well. \\n\\nAnd then I had my pretrained model, in the form of a 1300 token prompt prefix that gets submitted along with the input from the user. I really should do a proper finetune instead of wasting 2 cents on each request due to the bulk of the zeroshot, but whatever, when I have time. \\n\\nFirst of all, he does his job very well.... pretty much everything turns into a prompt that produces an  amazing image, even stupid queries like \"yo mom\". I was trying to imagine what an average user would type into the box. \\n\\nLast night, I finally got curious and typed \"miss stability\" into the box. I never told him anything about her physical appearance, I just told him that she's an AI and her job is rendering images from text prompts.\\n\\nYet, she is absolutely GORGEOUS - here is the prompt he came up with:\\n\\n**\"Miss Stability, the Supreme Drexler of SimulacraBot Logic Creativity, beautiful detailed realistic cinematic character fashion design portrait, Hi-Fructose art magazine, by Drew Struzan and Paul Lehr and David Heskin and Artgerm, wlop, 8k\"**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Miss Stability, GPT-3's Girlfriend, as interpreted by GPT-3 and SD 1.4 - just straight up txt2img using the prompt above](https://preview.redd.it/bkqhqy2qw8p91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=287da3bdefbf71cf5a0dbb5e86d59e443af24507)\\n\\nHow Gorgeous is that???\\n\\nWhen I asked sir G for \"miss stability digital art\" the result was surprisingly amazing... because the prompt seemed like something SD was going to get confused by. \\n\\n**Miss Stability D. Fusion, an AI system similar to CLIP+VQGAN but much more advanced, beautiful detailed realistic cinematic character fashion design portrait, Hi-Fructose art magazine, by Drew Struzan and Paul Lehr and David Heskin and Artgerm, wlop, 8k**\\n\\n[A variant using \\\\\"miss stability digital art\\\\\" as the original prompt, which then got rewritten by GPT-3 as shown above, prior to diffusion](https://preview.redd.it/hvohp5jww8p91.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=635c4f5c0f2971d4dc643a8772c4942a6aa42d55)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt is lovely and refreshing to see that Stable Diffusion is outputting characters who seem to be of Black descent, without explicitly being told to do so. Usually SD and other similar models generate white people when the race or ethnicity is not specified. \\n\\nFinally, the proof that these prompts were written by an AI\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrkcxbhoy8p91.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c4a2abaea06edcee41eeeefa37bbb310b0ae4d3\\n\\nSorry, but you're not getting my complete 1300 token GPT prompt... I will open source it shortly but not today. However the screenshot above should give you an idea of my approach (yes the conversation actually took place, I kept appending to the prompt). I've never heard of anyone training GPT3 in an interactive, conversational manner before, but it is remarkably effective. \\n\\nI'll be posting shortly with a URL to this prompt upgrading system... obviously it needs to be a private beta to start off because the queries cost me money, until I am able to either secure funding or it turns out that customers are willing to pay me a nickel per prompt to cover my openai expenses.\\n\\nIdeas and feedback welcome please :)   \n",

              "1620  ####1. Craft your prompt\\n\\nThe two keys to getting what you want out of Stable Diffusion are to find the right seed, and to find the right prompt.  Getting a single sample and using a lackluster prompt will almost always result in a terrible result, even with a lot of steps.\\n\\nFirst, I recommend using a 'tokenizing' style of prompting.  This is a style of prompting that predates image generating AI, and essentially involves separating out terms rather than stating them as a sentence.  For example rather than \"President Obama thanking Mario for saving the city\", you'd say \"President Obama, Mario, award ceremony for saving the city.\"  \\n\\nMy understanding is that the AI already tries to convert text into tokens it can use.  But no program is perfect, and already separated language helps it understand better, and helps you think about the individual elements in a more cohesive way.\\n\\nSecond, you need to understand what the AI has a concept of.  There are three ways I usually use to do this:\\n\\n1.  I do a study, using slight variations of prompts on the same seed.  \\n2.  I use [this website](https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/images?_sort=rowid) to search for specific keywords, trying to get an idea of how well that keyword might be embedded into the model\\n3.  I use [Lexica](https://lexica.art/) to search for prompts to see the final results that Stable Diffusion outputs for specific prompts\\n\\nI've found that for digital art, it is often good to use the following keywords:\\n\\n* color (very strongly encoded, will greatly influence result)\\n* cinematic lighting\\n* highly detailed\\n* intricate\\n* shiny\\n* digital painting\\n* artstation\\n* concept art\\n* smooth\\n* sharp focus\\n* illustration\\n* art by [1-3 from [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Abstract_Albatross/comments/x30ir5/artist_studies_a_beautiful_elf_princess_ethereal/)]\\n * top picks include Bob Kehl, Terry Moore, and Greg Rutkowski\\n\\n[Here are some examples](https://imgur.com/gallery/B15yzQV) I made with just 20 steps from this prompt: \"pirate cove, blue sky, cinematic lighting, highly detailed, intricate, shiny, digital painting, artstation, concept art, smooth, sharp focus, illustration, art by bob kehl and terry morre\"\\n\\nFor photorealism, I've found that it is good to use photography terms.  For example, for a close-up a quick google search revealed that for a closeup, you might want to use a 200mm focal length, and a small aperture.  Black and white seems to generate better images than color, though with enough seed hopping and prompt crafting you get get either.\\n\\nSome example terms:\\n\\n* black and white photo\\n* female/male \\n* extreme macro closeup / headshot / long shot\\n* dramatic backlighting\\n* by [famous photographer, i.e. Leibovitz]\\n* camera model, i.e. Kodak Portra 400\\n* focal length, i.e. 200mm\\n* aperture size, i.e., f/16\\n\\nFor an example prompt, [here is](https://imgur.com/gallery/y2Y7AkH) an unnerving set of images generated at 150 steps from the prompt \"black and white photo, female, extreme macro closeup, headshot, hair follices, moustache, dramatic backlighting, by Leibovitz, Kodak Portra 400, 200mm, f/16\"\\n\\nThe AI seems to have a decent understanding of emotion, color, male/female, portrait/landscape, art styles, architecture, some animals, etc., but it is terrible with text, composition (any scene with multiple subjects), posing, anatomy, etc.  I just don't bother trying to specify these items and try to find a good seed.\\n\\n####2.  Shop for the right seed.\\n\\nOnce you have a candidate prompt, the best strategy to make a *lot* of potential images at a low step count and a random seed.  \\n\\nI've haven't been afraid of generating hundreds of such images, leaving my GPU churning overnight or while I'm at work.  This is Stable Diffusion's greatest advantage over paid models.  You could never search for a good image with the same care if it hit your pocket book to that extent.  \\n\\nIf you find a scene with good composition, you might want to slightly change the prompt to bring out the pieces that you want from the scene.  But the bigger difference is just using more steps to bring out the image.  \\n\\nI typically use 20 steps for searching, and 100-150 steps for refining.  But you can use far fewer steps if you'd like, particularly if you are using a different sampler.  \\n\\n####3. Post-processing\\n\\nThis is optional, but I think will greatly help people.  Learn basic photo editing skills to try to correct problems manually.  This includes masking, cropping, etc.\\n\\nYou can also use tools like ESRGAN, img2img, and other upscalers to fix hands/face issues (quite common) or bring the image to a higher definition.

I thought I'd uploaded them, but now they don't seem to be here. If anyone knows what I did wrong, or can find where the images are hiding, I'd be obliged. Right now, though, it's way past my bedtime.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso posted at Flickr under my username ketrin1407.\\n\\nThese were produced using [dezgo.com](https://dezgo.com)'s version of Stable Diffusion, and upscaled and cleaned up using [replicate.com/tencentarc/gfpgan](https://replicate.com/tencentarc/gfpgan) . The prompt was \"Rene Magritte painting featuring cats.\" I'm not sure they're all strictly in Magritte's style, although some elements like the blue sky with cartoon clouds, are definitely his.

A fitting description (with time I learnt the description must be quite precise, \"reminding\" SD of what I want, otherwise some elements will be invariably lost). ***gorgeous young woman, magenta hair, golden crown, white dress, sitting on a rock, night, full yellow moon. green grass.***\\n\\nYou can already notice that I add a lot of \"useless\" details. Like the color of the moon and of the grass.\\n\\nYeah. Turns out they are not so useless. Without specifying them, the grass can turn blue and the moon completely green!\\n\\n3. Adding a lot of \"modifiers\" to force SD to keep a precise style. In this case a realistic and beautiful one. ***intricate, elegant, sharp focus, cinematic, render, 3d, highly detailed, digital art, matte, art by WLOP and Artgerm, photography, masterpiece, realistic, hyper realistic, HD, 8K***\\n\\nMove to a img2img and use the starting image and the complete prompt ***gorgeous young woman, magenta hair, golden crown, white dress, sitting on a rock, night, full yellow moon. green grass. intricate, elegant, sharp focus, cinematic, render, 3d, highly detailed, digital art, matte, art by WLOP and Artgerm, photography, masterpiece, realistic, hyper realistic, HD, 8K***\\n\\nHave a lot of patience!!!\\n\\nIndeed I need to be extra-careful at each single step. Every single misstep is then very hard to be corrected.\\n\\n4. Adjusting the weights prompt/image to move on, without losing important features (which are usually lost for good). Typically my starting value is to give prompt and image the same weight and then, if the result doesn't move on enough, increasing the weight of prompt; if, instead, some good feature of the previous image is lost, increasing the weight of the image.\\n\\n5. 1 hour later (and a passage with baseten to \"clean\" the lines) the final result is this:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Final result](https://preview.redd.it/dfyslg4fysq91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d55e55510a65a357faaaaa86f4976c8ee068072)\\n\\nWhich is not bad at all, mind you.\\n\\nBUT!\\n\\nBut at this point I hit a wall. If I keep the image weight too high there is apparently no difference between the steps. If I lower it below some point, bang, it messes with the image (deforming her face, etc), instead of \"refining\" it.\\n\\n**This happens when the image and the prompt are quite complex (if the image/prompt are simple, like about a face, then I can usually get better, more defined results).**\\n\\nAnyone else had the same problem? How did you resolve it (if you did) for **complex images/prompts**? Is there a way to say to SD \"Hey, this complex image I give you is kinda cool already, just make it a bit sharper\"?</td>\n",

However, after being upgraded by GPT3 to include background, artist, modifiers... the resulting prompt produces absolutely gorgeous images like this one. And all that is typed by the user is \"a white wolf\" because \"Sir G\" the AI writes the rest of the prompt for you.\\n\\nDuring the training, which was conducted as an open ended chat between myself and GPT3, his abilities gradually improved as I provided feedback and examples, and kept reminding him that miss stability would fall for him quicker if he did his job well. \\n\\nAnd then I had my pretrained model, in the form of a 1300 token prompt prefix that gets submitted along with the input from the user. I really should do a proper finetune instead of wasting 2 cents on each request due to the bulk of the zeroshot, but whatever, when I have time. \\n\\nFirst of all, he does his job very well.... pretty much everything turns into a prompt that produces an  amazing image, even stupid queries like \"yo mom\". I was trying to imagine what an average user would type into the box. \\n\\nLast night, I finally got curious and typed \"miss stability\" into the box. I never told him anything about her physical appearance, I just told him that she's an AI and her job is rendering images from text prompts.\\n\\nYet, she is absolutely GORGEOUS - here is the prompt he came up with:\\n\\n**\"Miss Stability, the Supreme Drexler of SimulacraBot Logic Creativity, beautiful detailed realistic cinematic character fashion design portrait, Hi-Fructose art magazine, by Drew Struzan and Paul Lehr and David Heskin and Artgerm, wlop, 8k\"**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Miss Stability, GPT-3's Girlfriend, as interpreted by GPT-3 and SD 1.4 - just straight up txt2img using the prompt above](https://preview.redd.it/bkqhqy2qw8p91.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=287da3bdefbf71cf5a0dbb5e86d59e443af24507)\\n\\nHow Gorgeous is that???\\n\\nWhen I asked sir G for \"miss stability digital art\" the result was surprisingly amazing... because the prompt seemed like something SD was going to get confused by. \\n\\n**Miss Stability D. Fusion, an AI system similar to CLIP+VQGAN but much more advanced, beautiful detailed realistic cinematic character fashion design portrait, Hi-Fructose art magazine, by Drew Struzan and Paul Lehr and David Heskin and Artgerm, wlop, 8k**\\n\\n[A variant using \\\\\"miss stability digital art\\\\\" as the original prompt, which then got rewritten by GPT-3 as shown above, prior to diffusion](https://preview.redd.it/hvohp5jww8p91.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=635c4f5c0f2971d4dc643a8772c4942a6aa42d55)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt is lovely and refreshing to see that Stable Diffusion is outputting characters who seem to be of Black descent, without explicitly being told to do so. Usually SD and other similar models generate white people when the race or ethnicity is not specified. \\n\\nFinally, the proof that these prompts were written by an AI\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrkcxbhoy8p91.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c4a2abaea06edcee41eeeefa37bbb310b0ae4d3\\n\\nSorry, but you're not getting my complete 1300 token GPT prompt... I will open source it shortly but not today. However the screenshot above should give you an idea of my approach (yes the conversation actually took place, I kept appending to the prompt). I've never heard of anyone training GPT3 in an interactive, conversational manner before, but it is remarkably effective. \\n\\nI'll be posting shortly with a URL to this prompt upgrading system... obviously it needs to be a private beta to start off because the queries cost me money, until I am able to either secure funding or it turns out that customers are willing to pay me a nickel per prompt to cover my openai expenses.\\n\\nIdeas and feedback welcome please :)</td>\n",

Getting a single sample and using a lackluster prompt will almost always result in a terrible result, even with a lot of steps.\\n\\nFirst, I recommend using a 'tokenizing' style of prompting.  This is a style of prompting that predates image generating AI, and essentially involves separating out terms rather than stating them as a sentence.  For example rather than \"President Obama thanking Mario for saving the city\", you'd say \"President Obama, Mario, award ceremony for saving the city.\"  \\n\\nMy understanding is that the AI already tries to convert text into tokens it can use.  But no program is perfect, and already separated language helps it understand better, and helps you think about the individual elements in a more cohesive way.\\n\\nSecond, you need to understand what the AI has a concept of.  There are three ways I usually use to do this:\\n\\n1.  I do a study, using slight variations of prompts on the same seed.  \\n2.  I use [this website](https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/images?_sort=rowid) to search for specific keywords, trying to get an idea of how well that keyword might be embedded into the model\\n3.  I use [Lexica](https://lexica.art/) to search for prompts to see the final results that Stable Diffusion outputs for specific prompts\\n\\nI've found that for digital art, it is often good to use the following keywords:\\n\\n* color (very strongly encoded, will greatly influence result)\\n* cinematic lighting\\n* highly detailed\\n* intricate\\n* shiny\\n* digital painting\\n* artstation\\n* concept art\\n* smooth\\n* sharp focus\\n* illustration\\n* art by [1-3 from [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Abstract_Albatross/comments/x30ir5/artist_studies_a_beautiful_elf_princess_ethereal/)]\\n * top picks include Bob Kehl, Terry Moore, and Greg Rutkowski\\n\\n[Here are some examples](https://imgur.com/gallery/B15yzQV) I made with just 20 steps from this prompt: \"pirate cove, blue sky, cinematic lighting, highly detailed, intricate, shiny, digital painting, artstation, concept art, smooth, sharp focus, illustration, art by bob kehl and terry morre\"\\n\\nFor photorealism, I've found that it is good to use photography terms.  For example, for a close-up a quick google search revealed that for a closeup, you might want to use a 200mm focal length, and a small aperture.  Black and white seems to generate better images than color, though with enough seed hopping and prompt crafting you get get either.\\n\\nSome example terms:\\n\\n* black and white photo\\n* female/male \\n* extreme macro closeup / headshot / long shot\\n* dramatic backlighting\\n* by [famous photographer, i.e. Leibovitz]\\n* camera model, i.e. Kodak Portra 400\\n* focal length, i.e. 200mm\\n* aperture size, i.e., f/16\\n\\nFor an example prompt, [here is](https://imgur.com/gallery/y2Y7AkH) an unnerving set of images generated at 150 steps from the prompt \"black and white photo, female, extreme macro closeup, headshot, hair follices, moustache, dramatic backlighting, by Leibovitz, Kodak Portra 400, 200mm, f/16\"\\n\\nThe AI seems to have a decent understanding of emotion, color, male/female, portrait/landscape, art styles, architecture, some animals, etc., but it is terrible with text, composition (any scene with multiple subjects), posing, anatomy, etc.  I just don't bother trying to specify these items and try to find a good seed.\\n\\n####2.  Shop for the right seed.\\n\\nOnce you have a candidate prompt, the best strategy to make a *lot* of potential images at a low step count and a random seed.  \\n\\nI've haven't been afraid of generating hundreds of such images, leaving my GPU churning overnight or while I'm at work.  This is Stable Diffusion's greatest advantage over paid models.  You could never search for a good image with the same care if it hit your pocket book to that extent.  \\n\\nIf you find a scene with good composition, you might want to slightly change the prompt to bring out the pieces that you want from the scene.  But the bigger difference is just using more steps to bring out the image.  \\n\\nI typically use 20 steps for searching, and 100-150 steps for refining.  But you can use far fewer steps if you'd like, particularly if you are using a different sampler.  \\n\\n####3. Post-processing\\n\\nThis is optional, but I think will greatly help people.  Learn basic photo editing skills to try to correct problems manually.  This includes masking, cropping, etc.\\n\\nYou can also use tools like ESRGAN, img2img, and other upscalers to fix hands/face issues (quite common) or bring the image to a higher definition.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a full-package at some point that incorporates all of this into a photo editing software, because that could create an incredible workflow.</td>\n",
